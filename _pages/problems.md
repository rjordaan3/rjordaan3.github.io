Here are some open problems I've spent some time thinking about. If you want to talk about any of these, please reach out!

## Total connectivity
For distinct vertices $u,v$ in a graph $G$ let $\kappa_G(u,v)$ denote the largest number of internally disjoint $u$-$v$ paths in $G$. The _total connectivity_ $T(G)$ is defined as $ \sum_{u,v \in V(G)} \kappa_G(u,v)$. The _average connectivity_ of $G$ is defined as $\frac{T(G)}{\binom{|V(G)|}{2}}$.
